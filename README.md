Electric Vehicle Market Segmentation in India
This project aims to analyze and segment the Indian Electric Vehicle (EV) market—specifically focused on four-wheeler buyers—using machine learning techniques. Realistic demographic and behavioral insights are extracted from user data to guide manufacturers and policymakers.

 Key Components:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understands the distribution of customer variables such as age, salary, car type, and loan status.

Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering: Customers are grouped into meaningful segments based on income, age, and car preference patterns.

Demographic Segmentation: Insights based on salary, marital status, dependents, and education level are explored.

Behavioral Insights: Analyzed how factors like spouse income, age, and family loans affect EV purchasing behavior.

State-wise EV Readiness Mapping: State clusters categorized by EV adoption, charging infrastructure, and policy support.

Market Strategy: Suggestions on the marketing mix (Innovation, Infrastructure, Experience, and Sustainability).

 Outcomes:
Most EV buyers are 26–38 years old, salaried, and married professionals with mid-range car preferences (SUVs).

Income has a clear correlation with car price, but loans do not heavily impact purchase decisions.

Brands like Baleno and i20 are popular among lower-income segments, while higher earners prefer SUVs and luxury vehicles.

 Tools & Techniques:
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering

Label Encoding and PCA for feature reduction
